# Titanic Project (Kaggle Competition)
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Predict survival on the Titanic using R. The purpose of this project is to practicing on model building.
I used data manipulation to make the data more organized and cleaned. 
Exploratory data analysis on the Survival(response variable) and passenger data(independent variables). And a simple correlation between these independent variables.
For the modeling part, I used logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest to do prediction.
